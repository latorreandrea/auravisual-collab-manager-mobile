# Auravisual Collab Manager (Mobile)
Auravisual Collab Manager is a lightweight, full-stack project management platform built with **FastAPI**, **Supabase**, and **Flutter**. It is designed to help small teams effectively manage projects, tasks, deadlines, and multi-user collaboration.

### Key Features:
- 🔐 User authentication and role management (admin, collaborator)
- 📁 Project creation, editing, and assignment
- ✅ Task tracking with deadlines and priorities
- 🧩 RESTful API backend (FastAPI) connected to Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- 📱 Cross-platform frontend (Flutter)

This project is part of my portfolio and demonstrates my experience with full-stack architecture, backend API design, secure authentication, and modern app development.
